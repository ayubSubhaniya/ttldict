TTLDict
=======

Python dictionaries with key expiry time

 - TTLDict - allows you to create a dict with ttl. Has a tricky API.
 - OrderedTTLDict - behaves more sanely. Use this!

 TTLDict will be soon deprecated, and is here only for reference.

Credits and Thanks:
-------------------

- mailgun for expiringdict

- Thomas Kemmer for
  https://github.com/tkem/cachetools

and for Jyrki Muukkonen for ttldict
published in https://github.com/jvtm/ttldict.

This library contains fixes for his TTLDict class
and my own OrderedTTLDict.

Without all those this work would not have been possible.
